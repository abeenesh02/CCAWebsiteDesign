# CCAWebsiteDesign
These are coding projects that involve front-end development of the CCAfrica's new Website.

The Event page is responsible for showcasing all upcoming events and past events and provides the ability for the user to view the 
events and register for the events they are interested in.

The Trade missions Page consists of the same functionality as the event page.

The About page provides a introduction to the company and their motives and also showcases all the members of the company.
